#DATA 221 ASSIGNMENT 1
this repository contains my solutions for Assignment 1 of DATA 221, each question is in a seperate python file as required.

## Files Overview

question 1.py : This is a controlled multiplication loop that multiplies consecutive integers starting from 1 until the product exceeds a given threshold

question 2.py : This program defines a fucntion that takes a list of strings returns a nested dictionary containing each string's length and parity

question 3.py : This program defines a power function and safely applies it to a list of (x, y) pairs, skipping pairs with negative exponents.

question 4.py : This program generates random values, sorts them, and finds indices where values are greater than or equal to a randomly generated number.

question 5.py : This program defines a function that validates circle radii, computes circle areas, and returns the percentage coverage of the smaller circle relative to the larger one.

question 6.py :  This program performs distribution analysis by returning a dictionary of percentages representing how many values are less than or equal to each unique number.

question 7.py : This program Converts a given number of seconds since midnight into hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format.

question 8.py : This program creates a Pandas DataFrame, adds a computed column derived from existing columns, and prints the final DataFrame.


##Requirments
-python 
-pandas(only used for question 8.py)

##Extra Notes
